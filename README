Simplewarp readme file: (copied from teh forum post)
    This is my first plugin, so be nice :)
    SimpleWarp is a simple plugin for handling warps. It has 3 commands:

        /warp <warpname> - Warps to the specified warp (Permissions node warp.go)
        /setwarp <warpname> - Creates a warp at your location (Permissions node warp.set)
        /listwarps - List the first 8 warps in your warps.txt file. (Permissions node warp.list)

    Features:

        Warping to a warp
        Creating new warps
        Permissions
        Warp listing
        Economy Support


    ToDo List (In order of importance):
