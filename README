This is my first plugin, so be nice :)
SimpleWarp is a simple plugin for handling warps. It has 2 commands:

    /warp <warpname> - Warps to the specified warp
    /setwarp <warpname> - Creates a warp at your location

In order to be able to use /setwarp, you must either be an Op or have the permissions node "set.warp" (Bukkit Permissions System)


Features:

    Warping to a warp
    Creating new warps
    Bukkit Permissions

ToDo List (In order of importance):

    Configuration File
    iConomy support
    MySQL/SQLite warp storage
    Warp Lists (/listwarps shows a list of warps)
